# gbafe-localization-tools
A suite of tools for assisting in creation of GBAFE mods and translations in languages other than English.

This repository is designed for use with buildfiles, but pieces of it can be imported via FEBuilder's "Install EA".

You will need your own FE8 (USA, Australia) saved as "FE8_clean.gba" in the root directory.
